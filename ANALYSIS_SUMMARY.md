# Test Failure Analysis - Summary

## Overview
This repository contains a complete analysis of test failures in PR #11 (commit `f7198cd67c3710ba94c0ddd2edc8951ba78ef10c`).

## Quick Reference

### The Problem
Three tests are failing in PR #11 due to incorrect test expectations introduced in commit `0adaae0`.

### The Solution  
Apply three single-line fixes to `tests/content.test.js`:

| Line | Current Value | Correct Value | Why |
|------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| 164 | `'gla'` | `'cigar'` | Test should validate the word that was added to ARCHIVE |
| 181 | `5` | `6` | Wordle has 6 rows, createMockBoard creates 6 rows |
| 255 | `'ABDE'` | `'ABCDE'` | 5 tiles with letters A,B,C,D,E produce 5-letter result |

### Implementation Impact
- ✅ No implementation code changes needed
- ✅ All code is working correctly
- ✅ Only test assertions need correction
