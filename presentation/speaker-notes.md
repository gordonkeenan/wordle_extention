# Speaker Notes - Couch Coding Presentation

This document contains all the speaker notes for the "Build with ChatGPT on your phone" presentation.

## Slide 1: The Rules
**Tracker: RULES**

- Good morning/afternoon. Today I'm sharing an experiment that proves just how powerful, and challenging, AI is becoming in development.
- The project was simple: Build a functional **Wordle helper browser extension**—a tracker—that could analyze guesses.
- The catch? It had to be built **using only ChatGPT** to write the code. And I could only use my **phone**—no laptop, no desktop IDE.

## Slide 2: The Goal: Moving from Coding to Couch Coding
**Tracker: LAZY**

- This slide clarifies the true purpose of the experiment. It wasn't just a gimmick, but a test of a new development philosophy.
- The idea of 'couch coding' is the ultimate developer fantasy: hands-free, purely conversational development.
- This is the radical shift: the language model becomes the entire execution environment, freeing the human to focus purely on specification and design, wherever they are.

## Slide 3: The Core Problem: Who Are We Helping?
**Tracker: HELP**

- Before diving into the coding, let's understand the core problem this extension solves.
- Wordle's two lists confuse people. You can guess 'SWORD', but Wordle might not accept 'SWORD' as a valid guess word because it's not in their smaller list.
- The goal was to make this distinction clear in real-time, helping players avoid wasted turns and frustration.

## Slide 4: Live Demo: Extension in Action
**Tracker: DEMO**

- This live demo shows the extension in its final form, providing real-time visual feedback as users type their Wordle guesses.
- Notice how the extension instantly categorizes words: blue for valid potential answers, red for invalid guesses, and purple for words that have already been solutions.
- This seamless user experience was built entirely through conversational AI development—proving that complex, interactive features can be created without traditional coding.

## Slide 5: Fighting with ChatGPT over File Size
**Tracker: FIGHT**

- This slide is the climax of the frustration. I was trying to include the 2,400-word list for the helper, but the files kept coming back empty.
- The AI repeatedly gave excuses, claiming the file size would exceed **500 kilobytes**, even though the list was only about **30 kilobytes** in reality.
- This back-and-forth went on for several generations, proving that the model was struggling with data integrity and context consistency.
- The final admission—that the problem was its internal *workspace* clipping the file—was the moment the AI's internal limitations were laid bare, forcing me to shift strategies.

## Slide 6: The Pivot: Transitioning to Pro-Code
**Tracker: MOVES**

- After the meltdown, the game changed. I had had to abandon the pure conversational approach to fix the broken data structure.
- This meant moving the code into GitHub for version control, and using Copilot to rapidly fix and modularize the spaghetti code generated by ChatGPT.
- This pivot proved that while conversational AI is great for generation, traditional version control and AI assistance (like Copilot) are essential for sustained project health.
- I want to emphasize this was still entirely mobile. The phone became the new terminal and IDE, proving truly mobile development is here.

## Slide 7: Coding from the Future (on a Phone)
**Tracker: FUTURE**

- If I can build a working extension using only voice and mobile typing, imagine what professional teams can do with dedicated AI tools built into their established workflows.
- The barrier to entry for development is dissolving; the new barrier is **precision in communication**.
- The future of coding is truly mobile and conversational.

## Slide 8: The Iterative Development Loop
**Tracker: LOOP**

- The development workflow became a tight, iterative loop that could be completed in minutes.
- Prompt: Describe the feature or fix needed in natural language to ChatGPT.
- Zip: Recieve the generated code in a Zip file
- Test: Load the extension into Safari tampermonkey plugin.
- Patch: Identify issues and start the loop again with a new prompt.

## Slide 9: Final Thoughts & Q/A
**Tracker: QUESTIONS**

- Thank you for listening. I encourage everyone here to try a similar challenge. It's a powerful lesson in both AI capabilities and limitations.
- I'd be happy to share the repository. Now, what questions do you have about the process, the code, or the array meltdown?

## Slide 10: The Challenge: No Code. No Laptop. Just Prompts.
**Tracker: PROMPT**

- This wasn't about using AI as a helper; it was about using **prompts alone** as the *entire* development environment.
- I wanted to see how far a non-programmer could technically go, or, in my case, how far an experienced programmer could go without touching a keyboard or IDE.
- Every single line of JavaScript, HTML, and manifest code was generated by conversation.

## Slide 11: Feature 1: Validating Guesses (Red vs. Blue)
**Tracker: VALID/INVALID**

- The primary feature is the Red vs. Blue validation, instantly showing if a word is worth typing.
- Blue means the word is both a valid guess AND could be a potential answer.
- Red means the word isn't even a valid guess in Wordle's dictionary.

## Slide 12: Feature 2: Tracking Past Answers (Purple)
**Tracker: PAST**

- Purple indicates a word that was already a Wordle answer in the past.
- This prevents users from guessing words that won't be the answer because they've already been used.
- This feature required maintaining a database of past Wordle solutions.

## Slide 13: Coding by Conversation
**Tracker: ARRAY**

- This slide shows how natural language drove the entire development process.
- Each feature was requested in plain English and delivered as working code.
- The conversational approach made complex programming accessible to non-programmers.

## Slide 14: Decision Fatigue
**Tracker: LIMIT**

- One limitation was that ChatGPT began deferring decisions back to me after extended conversations.
- The AI became less autonomous and more hesitant to make implementation choices.
- This suggests that conversational AI works best for shorter, focused development sessions.

## Slide 15: When ChatGPT Just Keeps Asking…
**Tracker: LO00000OOPS**

- This was one of the most frustrating aspects of the conversational approach.
- The AI would ask questions about implementation details instead of making sensible defaults.
- This highlighted the need for better AI training on when to be autonomous vs. when to ask for guidance.

## Slide 16: Mobile Workflow: Code is on the Couch
**Tracker: PHONE**

- This proves that modern development can be completely mobile.
- Mobile browsers now have surprisingly capable developer tools.
- The combination of AI coding and mobile tools creates true location-independent development.

## Slide 17: Build System Modernization
**Tracker: SWIFT**

- ChatGPT excelled at modernizing legacy code patterns.
- The AI could instantly apply best practices and modern JavaScript features.
- This shows how AI can help maintain and improve existing codebases.

## Slide 18: Implementing AI-Driven Unit Tests
**Tracker: TEST**

- One surprising behavior was that ChatGPT often suggested testing without being prompted.
- The AI understood the importance of reliability and maintainability.
- This shows how AI can help enforce good development practices automatically.

## Slide 19: Lessons Learned
**Tracker: LEARN**

- The experiment revealed both the potential and limitations of conversational coding.
- AI excels at rapid prototyping but struggles with complex state and large files.
- The key is understanding when to use AI and when to switch to traditional tools.

## Slide 20: Productivity Hacks: AI as Your Content Partner
**Tracker: HACKS**

- This presentation itself was largely AI-generated, including speaker notes.
- AI can handle the entire content creation pipeline, not just coding.
- This represents a fundamental shift in how we think about AI assistance.

## Slide 21: The Meta-Workflow: Built by AI
**Tracker: META**

- This slide represents the meta-aspect of the experiment.
- Not only was the extension built by AI, but so was the presentation about building it.
- This creates a recursive loop of AI-assisted documentation and development.

## Slide 22: Do's & Don'ts: Best Practices for Agent Development
**Tracker: CHECK**

- These practices emerged from real experience building with conversational AI.
- The key is understanding AI as a powerful but imperfect development partner.
- Success requires adapting traditional development practices to AI's strengths and weaknesses.
