## 3. Recommendations for Browser Extensions vs Standalone Applications for Accessibility Tools

When considering accessibility tools, developers must weigh the benefits of browser extensions against standalone applications:

    - Easier to install and update.
    - Can easily integrate with existing web services.
    - Lower barrier to entry for users.
  - **Cons**:
    - Limited by the capabilities of the browser.
    - May face stricter policies from web stores.

- **Standalone Applications**:
  - **Pros**:
    - Greater control over functionality and user interface.
    - Can operate independently of browser limitations.
    - More flexibility in handling user data and privacy.
  - **Cons**:
    - Higher installation and maintenance efforts.
    - Users may be hesitant to download unknown applications.

**Conclusion**: The choice between a browser extension and a standalone application depends on the specific needs of the accessibility tool being developed. Consider the target audience, intended functionality, and compliance with relevant legal frameworks when making this choice.
